# User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Purpose
The overall goal of this challenge assignment is to refactoring existing code to meet a certain set of standards in the challenge readme file. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. This project's purpose is to teach about the concept of divs and semantic HTML elements, as well as the importance of parent and child elements within the code. It is also essential to follow a scout rule of cleaning the code and leaving it better than it's original. This assignment solves the confusion a student may have understanding these basic (but essential rooted) concepts of HTML. I learned the importance of these elements and how simpilar it is to understand code when it's neatly condensed & readable.
 


## Project Process
 1. Create assignment repository
 2. View original, given code, clone it and add it to your repo
 3. save an original copy of the code (in case something happens)
 4. replace div elements with semantic elements and ensure they line up with CSS coding (open the HTMl in live browser as you go to ensure the CSS style format won't be altered. 
 5. Make sure to correctly ident and form your code, check each start has an end tag
 6. Condense any similar CSS classes that share exact CSS style elements
 7. Add comments for yourself and the viewer to better understand the process
 8. Once everything is done, open the terminal and proceed to git add. then git commit -m"commit name" and finally git push to the repo
